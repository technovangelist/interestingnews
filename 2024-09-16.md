The article discusses the importance of testing Large Language Models (LLMs) before implementing them in a project. It highlights two main concerns when choosing an LLM: overall performance against specific documents and data security. The author provides several tests to evaluate the quality of an LLM, including text generation, answers to common questions, answers to questions in conversation format, grammatical error correction, and text summary. The article also touches on other important parameters to consider when evaluating LLMs, such as cost, number of parameters, context length, GPU and disk space requirements.
