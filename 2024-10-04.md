## Reclaiming AI as a Theoretical Tool for Cognitive Science | Computational Brain & Behavior

The paper "Reclaiming AI as a Theoretical Tool for Cognitive Science" is a critical analysis of the current state of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and its relationship to cognitive science. The authors argue that AI has strayed from its original purpose of being a theoretical tool for cognitive science, instead becoming an engineering field focused on building human-like intelligence.

The authors claim that this shift in focus has led to a misunderstanding of cognition and has resulted in AIs being used as substitutes for human cognition, rather than as tools to understand and explain it. They also argue that the current hype around AI and machine learning is misleading, as most AI systems are not capable of true human-like intelligence.

The authors present several theoretical arguments against the notion that AI can be used to build human-like intelligence, including the idea that cognitive science requires a more nuanced understanding of cognition than what current AI approaches provide. They also argue that the focus on building human-like intelligence is misguided, as it ignores the complexity and diversity of human cognition.

The authors conclude by advocating for a return to the original purpose of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science, one that prioritizes understanding and explaining cognition rather than simply building human-like intelligence. They propose several alternative approaches, including the use of computational models to simulate human cognition and the development of new theoretical frameworks that can better capture the complexity of human cognition.

Overall, this paper provides a critical examination of the current state of AI research and its relationship to cognitive science, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of cognition and the importance of returning to the original purpose of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science.
