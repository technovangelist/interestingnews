## Reclaiming AI as a Theoretical Tool for Cognitive Science | Computational Brain & Behavior
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-024-00217-5" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-024-00217-5</a>

The paper "Reclaiming AI as a Theoretical Tool for Cognitive Science" is a critical analysis of the current state of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and its relationship to cognitive science. The authors argue that AI has strayed from its original purpose of being a theoretical tool for cognitive science, instead becoming an engineering field focused on building human-like intelligence.

The authors claim that this shift in focus has led to a misunderstanding of cognition and has resulted in AIs being used as substitutes for human cognition, rather than as tools to understand and explain it. They also argue that the current hype around AI and machine learning is misleading, as most AI systems are not capable of true human-like intelligence.

The authors present several theoretical arguments against the notion that AI can be used to build human-like intelligence, including the idea that cognitive science requires a more nuanced understanding of cognition than what current AI approaches provide. They also argue that the focus on building human-like intelligence is misguided, as it ignores the complexity and diversity of human cognition.

The authors conclude by advocating for a return to the original purpose of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science, one that prioritizes understanding and explaining cognition rather than simply building human-like intelligence. They propose several alternative approaches, including the use of computational models to simulate human cognition and the development of new theoretical frameworks that can better capture the complexity of human cognition.

Overall, this paper provides a critical examination of the current state of AI research and its relationship to cognitive science, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of cognition and the importance of returning to the original purpose of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science.

Apple has developed a new AI model called Depth Pro, which revolutionizes 3D vision by generating detailed depth maps from single 2D images in a fraction of a second without relying on camera data. This technology has significant implications across industries such as augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, and e-commerce, where real-time spatial awareness is key. Depth Pro excels in capturing fine details like fur and birdcage wires, producing high-resolution depth maps in just 0.3 seconds. The model's ability to estimate both relative and absolute depth, called "metric depth," makes it highly versatile and suitable for applications such as AR and autonomous vehicles. Apple has made Depth Pro open-source, allowing developers and researchers to experiment with and further refine the technology, which could accelerate its adoption and impact various industries.

## It’s Time to Stop Taking Sam Altman at His Word - The Atlantic
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/sam-altman-mythmaking/680152/" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/sam-altman-mythmaking/680152/</a>

The article critiques OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's vision for AI, which promises boundless prosperity and transformative impact, but feels like Silicon Valley mythmaking. Altman recently published a manifesto claiming that his technology will solve climate change, establish space colonies, and uncover all of physics in just a few thousand days, with little evidence to back up these claims. The article argues that OpenAI's products currently feel more like the present than the future, with chatbots and image generators plateauing after their initial hype. Altman's approach is reminiscent of previous tech boom narratives, where entrepreneurs and investors tout revolutionary technologies that never quite materialize. The article questions whether Altman, a serial entrepreneur without a physics background, genuinely understands the technical limitations of his AI technology and if he is using regulation to obscure the underwhelming details of existing AI use cases, instead focusing on an imagined future benefits.

## How the 2024 Election Will Shape the Future of AI | Scientific American
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-2024-election-will-shape-the-future-of-ai/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-2024-election-will-shape-the-future-of-ai/</a>

The upcoming US presidential election is expected to shape the future of artificial intelligence (AI) in the country, with both candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump taking different approaches to addressing its risks and benefits. While both candidates support innovation in AI, Harris has been more outspoken about its potential dangers to individuals, particularly vulnerable populations such as children, and has proposed specific policy steps to protect them. In contrast, Trump's views on AI are largely vague, with some critics arguing that his approach is insufficient to address the technology's risks. The next president will have a critical role in shaping AI policy, including addressing issues such as AI safety, data protection, and the potential for AI-generated misinformation. As the White House prepares for mounting pressure from Congress and the public to respond to AI, voters must decide which candidate is best equipped to tackle the complex challenges of an AI era.
