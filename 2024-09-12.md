## This Chatbot Pulls People Away From Conspiracy Theories
[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/health/chatbot-debunk-conspiracy-theories.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/health/chatbot-debunk-conspiracy-theories.html)

Here is a brief summary of the article, no longer than 200 words:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is updating its labeling system for edited content on these platforms. The company will now hide the "AI Info" label in a menu for images and videos that have been lightly edited using generative AI tools. Previously, the label was displayed directly beneath the user's name. This change aims to better reflect the extent of AI used in editing content. Meta says it will still display the "AI info" label for content generated by an AI tool, but will now check for industry-shared signals, such as digital watermarks applied by other companies like Adobe and Google. The updated labeling system is intended to provide more transparency about edited content, while also avoiding false positives on real images that have been manipulated using generative AI tools.

Here is a brief summary of the article in 200 words or less:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is changing how it labels edited content on its platforms. Previously, AI-generated content was labeled as "Made with AI" directly beneath the user's name. However, Meta is now moving to a more nuanced approach where labels for AI-edited content will appear behind a menu, rather than front and center. This change aims to "better reflect the extent of AI used" across images and videos on the platforms. The company says this update will start rolling out next week. Meanwhile, labels for AI-generated content remain prominent, as do those for content that has been self-disclosed or flagged by industry-shared signals.

## Facebook and Instagram are making AI labels less prominent on edited content

Here is a brief summary of the article, within the 200-word limit:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is changing how it labels content edited or manipulated using generative AI on its platforms. The "AI Info" label will no longer be displayed directly beneath user names for images and videos that have been lightly edited with AI tools. Instead, users can click a menu in the top-right corner to view information about potential AI edits. Meta claims this change is intended to "better reflect the extent of AI used" across content on its platforms. The company will still display the "AI Info" label for content generated by an AI tool, and notes that it will be updating its systems to check for various industry-standard signals, such as Adobe's Content Credentials metadata.

## Forget GPT-5! OpenAI launches new AI model family o1 claiming PhD-level performance
[https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-gpt-5-openai-launches-new-ai-model-family-o1-claiming-phd-level-performance/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-gpt-5-openai-launches-new-ai-model-family-o1-claiming-phd-level-performance/)

This article discusses the latest advancements in OpenAI's AI technology, specifically the o1 series, which includes two models: o1-preview and o1-mini. Here are the key points:

**o1-preview**

* A more advanced model designed to handle complex problems
* Has performed at a level close to that of PhD students in areas like physics, chemistry, and biology
* Excels in coding, ranking 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions
* Demonstrated prowess in the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam, solving 83% of the problems

**o1-mini**

* A more streamlined version designed to offer faster and cheaper reasoning capabilities
* Less powerful than o1-preview but 80% cheaper
* Performs well in math and programming tasks, with a score of 70% on the IMO math benchmark
* Achieved an Elo score of 1650 on Codeforces, positioning it among the top 86% of programmers

**Safety and security enhancements**

* Both models incorporate a new safety training approach that enhances their ability to follow safety and alignment guidelines
* o1-preview scored an impressive 84 on one of OpenAI's toughest jailbreaking tests, a significant improvement over GPT-4o's score of 22
* OpenAI has entered into agreements with the U.S. and U.K. AI Safety Institutes for early access to research versions of the o1 models

**What's next**

* OpenAI plans to regularly update and improve the o1 series, including adding features like browsing, file and image uploading, and function calling
* The company will continue to develop both its GPT and o1 series, further expanding the capabilities of AI in various fields

## DataGemma: Using real-world data to address AI hallucinations
[https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-datagemma-ai-llm/](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-datagemma-ai-llm/)

The article is reporting on the development of two notebooks for AI-powered research: one for the RIG (Research Investigation Generator) approach and another for the RAG (Research Analysis Generator) approach. These notebooks are designed to help researchers learn about how Data Commons and Gemma work together, as described in a research post by Google.

The article also mentions that these notebooks are part of Google's efforts to support small businesses with AI tools through its initiative called "Google.org". The other stories linked to this one mention various AI-related projects, such as helping small businesses grow with AI, releasing an AI-powered audio feature for the NotebookLM tool, and using AI to help cities tackle extreme heat. 

However, there is no specific information provided about the content of the notebooks themselves or what they are used for. The article only provides links to the Google Colab notebooks, which contain the actual code and research.
