Here is a brief summary of the article, no longer than 200 words:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is updating its labeling system for edited content on these platforms. The company will now hide the "AI Info" label in a menu for images and videos that have been lightly edited using generative AI tools. Previously, the label was displayed directly beneath the user's name. This change aims to better reflect the extent of AI used in editing content. Meta says it will still display the "AI info" label for content generated by an AI tool, but will now check for industry-shared signals, such as digital watermarks applied by other companies like Adobe and Google. The updated labeling system is intended to provide more transparency about edited content, while also avoiding false positives on real images that have been manipulated using generative AI tools.## Learning to Reason with LLMs

Here is a brief summary of the article in 200 words or less:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is changing how it labels edited content on its platforms. Previously, AI-generated content was labeled as "Made with AI" directly beneath the user's name. However, Meta is now moving to a more nuanced approach where labels for AI-edited content will appear behind a menu, rather than front and center. This change aims to "better reflect the extent of AI used" across images and videos on the platforms. The company says this update will start rolling out next week. Meanwhile, labels for AI-generated content remain prominent, as do those for content that has been self-disclosed or flagged by industry-shared signals.## DataGemma: Using real-world data to address AI hallucinations

The article is announcing the start of notebooks for both the RIG and RAG approaches, which are used in conjunction with Data Commons and Gemma. The RIG and RAG approaches are likely related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. 

Here's a brief summary:

* Data Commons and Gemma are collaborating on AI projects.
* Notebooks have been started for the RIG and RAG approaches, which will help with these collaborations.
* The article invites readers to learn more about how Data Commons and Gemma work together through a research post.
* The article is part of Google's blog series on AI.

Here is a brief summary of the article in 200 words:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is updating its labeling policy for AI-generated content on its platforms. The company will no longer display the "AI Info" label directly under user names for edited content that has been manipulated using generative AI tools. Instead, users will need to click a menu icon in the top-right corner of images or videos to access the information. This change aims to provide more nuance in labeling content that has been lightly adjusted with AI features or fully AI-generated from a prompt. The move comes after Meta's previous "Made with AI" label was criticized for incorrectly tagging real photos taken by photographers and creators. The updated policy will start rolling out next week, with the company also promising to continue displaying labels for content generated directly by AI tools.## Forget GPT-5! OpenAI launches new AI model family o1 claiming PhD-level performance

This article discusses the launch of OpenAI's new models, o1-preview and o1-mini, which are designed for complex problem-solving and reasoning tasks. Here are the key points:

**o1-preview:**

* Performs at a level close to that of PhD students in areas like physics, chemistry, and biology
* Excels in coding, ranking in the 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions
* Solves 83% of problems on the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam

**o1-mini:**

* A more streamlined version designed for faster and cheaper reasoning capabilities
* Optimized primarily for coding and STEM tasks, with strong performance in math and programming
* Scores 70% on the IMO math benchmark, matching o1-preview's score while being 80% lower in cost
* Performs competitively in coding evaluations, achieving an Elo score of 1650 on Codeforces

**Safety and security enhancements:**

* Both models incorporate a new safety training approach that enhances their ability to follow safety and alignment guidelines
* o1-preview scored an impressive 84 on one of OpenAI's toughest jailbreaking tests, a significant improvement over GPT-4o's score of 22
* Partnerships with the U.S. and U.K. AI Safety Institutes for early access to research versions of the models

**Future plans:**

* Regular updates and improvements to the o1 series, including adding features like browsing, file and image uploading, and function calling
* Continued development of both GPT and o1 series, with ongoing advancements in increasing the usefulness and accessibility of these models across different applications.## AI can change belief in conspiracy theories, study finds
