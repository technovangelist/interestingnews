'## This Chatbot Pulls People Away From Conspiracy Theories

Here is a brief summary of the article, no longer than 200 words:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is updating its labeling system for edited content on these platforms. The company will now hide the "AI Info" label in a menu for images and videos that have been lightly edited using generative AI tools. Previously, the label was displayed directly beneath the user's name. This change aims to better reflect the extent of AI used in editing content. Meta says it will still display the "AI info" label for content generated by an AI tool, but will now check for industry-shared signals, such as digital watermarks applied by other companies like Adobe and Google. The updated labeling system is intended to provide more transparency about edited content, while also avoiding false positives on real images that have been manipulated using generative AI tools.

Here is a brief summary of the article in 200 words or less:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is changing how it labels edited content on its platforms. Previously, AI-generated content was labeled as "Made with AI" directly beneath the user's name. However, Meta is now moving to a more nuanced approach where labels for AI-edited content will appear behind a menu, rather than front and center. This change aims to "better reflect the extent of AI used" across images and videos on the platforms. The company says this update will start rolling out next week. Meanwhile, labels for AI-generated content remain prominent, as do those for content that has been self-disclosed or flagged by industry-shared signals.

'## Facebook and Instagram are making AI labels less prominent on edited content

Here is a brief summary of the article, within the 200-word limit:

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is making changes to how it labels content that has been edited or manipulated using generative AI. The "AI Info" tag will no longer be displayed directly beneath user names for content that has only been lightly edited with AI tools. Instead, users will have to click on a menu in the top-right corner of images and videos to view the label, which will now appear behind a dropdown menu. This change is intended to "better reflect the extent of AI used" across images and videos on the platforms. The company notes that the changes are being introduced to avoid incorrectly tagging real photos that have been taken by humans, but critics argue that this may also make it harder for users to avoid being misled about the authenticity of content.

'## Forget GPT-5! OpenAI launches new AI model family o1 claiming PhD-level performance
[https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-gpt-5-openai-launches-new-ai-model-family-o1-claiming-phd-level-performance/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-gpt-5-openai-launches-new-ai-model-family-o1-claiming-phd-level-performance/)

This article discusses the latest developments in OpenAI's AI models, specifically the o1-preview and o1-mini models. Here are the main points:

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **o1-preview model**: This model has been trained on a wide range of tasks and has shown impressive performance in areas like physics, chemistry, biology, and coding.
2. **o1-mini model**: A more streamlined version designed for faster and cheaper reasoning capabilities, optimized primarily for coding and STEM tasks.
3. **Safety enhancements**: Both models incorporate a new safety training approach that enhances their ability to follow safety and alignment guidelines.
4. **Partnerships**: OpenAI has entered into agreements with the U.S. and U.K. AI Safety Institutes to help in the evaluation and testing of future AI systems.

**Technical Details:**

1. **o1-preview performance**: The model has performed at a level close to that of PhD students in areas like physics, chemistry, and biology.
2. **Codeforces ranking**: The o1-preview model ranked 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions.
3. **IMO benchmark**: o1-preview demonstrated its prowess by solving 83% of the problems, a sharp improvement over GPT-4o's success rate.

**Availability:**

1. **ChatGPT access**: Both models are already available for use in ChatGPT by Plus and Team users.
2. **Enterprise and Edu access**: Users will gain access to these models next week.
3. **OpenAI API availability**: The models are also available via the OpenAI API for developers who qualify for API usage tier 5.

**Future Plans:**

1. **Regular updates**: OpenAI plans to regularly update and improve these models, including adding features like browsing, file and image uploading, and function calling.
2. **Development of both GPT and o1 series**: The company will continue to develop both its GPT and o1 series, further expanding the capabilities of AI in various fields.

To start a notebook for both the RIG and RAG approaches, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Google Colab platform.
2. Click on "New Notebook" in the top left corner of the page.
3. Choose a name for your notebook, such as "RIG_and_RAG".
4. In the new notebook, click on the "+" button at the top right corner and select "Cell" from the dropdown menu.
5. In the first cell, add the following code to import the necessary libraries:
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from transformers import RIG, RAG
```
6. In the second cell, add the code to load the dataset you want to work with (e.g., a CSV file).
7. In the third cell, add the code to create an instance of the RIG model and another instance for the RAG model.
8. In subsequent cells, you can add code to experiment with different settings for both models, such as tuning hyperparameters or trying out different architectures.
