## Most Americans don't trust AI-powered election information: AP-NORC/USAFacts survey
[https://apnews.com/article/ai-chatbots-misinformation-voting-election-2024-7131822c0f2ebe843b4c7e3cb111a3d3](https://apnews.com/article/ai-chatbots-misinformation-voting-election-2024-7131822c0f2ebe843b4c7e3cb111a3d3){:target="_blank"}

A survey by The Associated Press and NORC/USAFacts found that most Americans do not trust artificial intelligence-powered chatbots or search results to provide accurate answers, especially when it comes to information about elections. Only a small portion of respondents believed AI-generated results were always or often based on factual information.

## AI safety showdown: Yann LeCun slams California’s SB 1047 as Geoffrey Hinton backs new regulations
[https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-safety-showdown-yann-lecun-slams-californias-sb-1047-as-geoffrey-hinton-backs-new-regulations/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-safety-showdown-yann-lecun-slams-californias-sb-1047-as-geoffrey-hinton-backs-new-regulations/){:target="_blank"}

The article discusses the disagreement between two artificial intelligence (AI) pioneers, Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton, over California's SB 1047 bill, which aims to regulate AI development. LeCun criticized supporters of the bill, saying they have a distorted view of what is coming next with AI due to inexperience, naïveté, and wild overestimates of their employer's lead. Hinton, on the other hand, endorsed the bill, citing potential catastrophic harm from powerful AI models. The debate highlights the complexity of regulating a rapidly evolving technology and may set a precedent for how societies grapple with the promises and perils of increasingly powerful AI systems.

## AI can change belief in conspiracy theories, study finds
[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/12/ai-can-change-belief-in-conspiracy-theories-study-finds](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/12/ai-can-change-belief-in-conspiracy-theories-study-finds){:target="_blank"}

Researchers found that the AI system was able to reduce people’s belief in a conspiracy theory by pointing out flaws and inconsistencies, and by acknowledging and validating their emotions.

## Transformers, Sub-Quadratic Systems, And Liquid Neurons
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/09/12/transformers-sub-quadratic-systems-and-liquid-neurons/?ss=ai](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/09/12/transformers-sub-quadratic-systems-and-liquid-neurons/?ss=ai){:target="_blank"}

The article discusses new types of neural networks that can increase performance without sacrificing accuracy, also known as Liquid AI. It highlights the challenges of traditional transformer models, which rely on quadratic inference cost, and how sub-quadratic systems like Mamba and BASED aim to solve this problem. The author also mentions liquid neurons, which replace traditional functions with liquid functions for more interpretable processes.

## Facebook and Instagram are making AI labels less prominent on edited content
[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242998/facebook-instagram-ai-label-update-edited-content](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242998/facebook-instagram-ai-label-update-edited-content){:target="_blank"}

Facebook and Instagram are changing how they label AI-edited content, making the labels less prominent for images and videos that have only been lightly edited using generative AI tools. The 'AI Info' tag will now appear in a menu at the top-right corner of the image or video, allowing users to click and view more information if desired.

## How to prompt on GPT-o1
[https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-to-prompt-on-gpt-o1/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-to-prompt-on-gpt-o1/){:target="_blank"}

The article discusses how to prompt on GPT-o1, a new model from OpenAI that promises better reasoning capabilities than previous models. Unlike earlier models, GPT-o1 performs best with straightforward prompts and does not require guidance or complex context windows. The article provides tips for using the model effectively, including keeping prompts simple and direct, avoiding chain-of-thought prompts, and limiting additional context.

## DataGemma: Using real-world data to address AI hallucinations
[https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-datagemma-ai-llm/](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-datagemma-ai-llm/){:target="_blank"}

The article discusses the challenges of hallucination in large language models (LLMs) and introduces DataGemma, open models designed to address this challenge by grounding LLMs in real-world statistical data from Google's Data Commons. The article highlights the importance of trustworthy data in AI decision-making and presents two approaches: RIG (Retrieval-Interleaved Generation) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which aim to reduce hallucinations by incorporating relevant information from Data Commons.

## Forget GPT-5! OpenAI launches new AI model family o1 claiming PhD-level performance
[https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-gpt-5-openai-launches-new-ai-model-family-o1-claiming-phd-level-performance/](https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-gpt-5-openai-launches-new-ai-model-family-o1-claiming-phd-level-performance/){:target="_blank"}

OpenAI has launched a new family of AI models called o1, which are designed to 'reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems' than the GPT series. The o1-series includes two models: o1-preview and o1-mini. O1-preview is capable of performing at PhD levels in areas such as physics, chemistry, and biology, while o1-mini is a more streamlined version that is 80% cheaper but still delivers strong performance in math and programming.
