The article discusses the importance of small language models (SLMs) in today's AI landscape, particularly in the age of large language models (LLMs). It highlights the advantages of SLMs in terms of efficiency, interpretability, and cost-effectiveness. The study examines the role of SLMs in collaboration with LLMs, as well as their competition against them. It also discusses various scenarios where SLMs are more effective than LLMs, such as computation-constrained environments, task-specific applications, and situations requiring high interpretability.

The article discusses the importance of testing Large Language Models (LLMs) before implementing them in a project. It highlights two main concerns when choosing an LLM: overall performance against specific documents and data security. The author provides several tests to evaluate the quality of an LLM, including text generation, answers to common questions, answers to questions in conversation format, grammatical error correction, and text summary. The article also touches on other important parameters to consider when evaluating LLMs, such as cost, number of parameters, context length, GPU and disk space requirements.
