## Transformers, Sub-Quadratic Systems, And Liquid Neurons
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/09/12/transformers-sub-quadratic-systems-and-liquid-neurons/?ss=ai" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/09/12/transformers-sub-quadratic-systems-and-liquid-neurons/?ss=ai</a>

The article discusses new types of neural networks that can increase performance without sacrificing accuracy, also known as Liquid AI. It highlights the challenges of traditional transformer models, which rely on quadratic inference cost, and how sub-quadratic systems like Mamba and BASED aim to solve this problem. The author also mentions liquid neurons, which replace traditional functions with liquid functions for more interpretable processes.

Copper wires have already failed clustered AI systems due to their limitations and unreliability. Ayar Labs claims that optical I/O chips can increase throughput and profitability, and is urging companies like Nvidia to adopt this technology.

## First impressions of OpenAI o1: An AI designed to overthink it
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/first-impressions-of-openai-o1-an-ai-designed-to-overthink-it/" target="_blank">https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/first-impressions-of-openai-o1-an-ai-designed-to-overthink-it/</a>

The article discusses OpenAI's latest AI model, o1, which is designed to reason and answer complex questions. While o1 excels at certain tasks, it lacks the tools, multimodal capabilities, and speed of its predecessor GPT-4o. The model is also more expensive to use than GPT-4o. The article concludes that o1 is a tentative step in the direction of more advanced AI models, but not a revolutionary leap forward.
